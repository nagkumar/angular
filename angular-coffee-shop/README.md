# preface

This Code is written as per #CleanCode Standards of TejaSoft, based on our expertise of working with more than 1.2 billion lines of various stack code. Some naming conventions as
per our standard, as most frameworks and their naming/directory structure styles do have the flows that makes large code working too difficult to maintain.

e.g we follow different directly structure than what is generated by angular cli to keep related files together that eases maintainability We also think of Java Class Naming
style (especially those that needs to go to backend) and prefer classes rather than functional interfaces. However, function are preferred for utility code.

These are our recommendations, however once in contract, we go with whatever is customers feel comfortable. Our braces formatting is also different that what is seen in books (
books use it to save pages space but not good for large code enterprise products)

Few Checks:

1. Make sure everything is from the latest angular versions
2. Are tests done: Tests are avoided due to test scope
3. Types are defined as much as possible
4. Each class and method as small as possible
5. Scopes as tight as possible - some are avoided
6. Validations - were limited due to test scope

# Angular CLI Coffee Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
